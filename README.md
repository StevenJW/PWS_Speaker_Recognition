# PWS_Speaker_Recognition
This is a project made for a PWS (profielwerkstuk/ profile project) of a Dutch highschool. This Project was in collaboration with https://github.com/MathewB-A. This project included writing a 'scientific paper' about the subject.  
We managed to achieve an accuracy of 90%+ for two speakers and one vowel, using 100 audiofiles each saying solely 'e'. The more I learn about ML, the less impressed I am of what we have made but we were proud when we first got it working.

## Using the project
As of writing, the code is all very messy since there was no good directory structure and code structure. In the future I will try my best to update the code so it could theoretically be used (also have a look at the data section). This section will also be updated with an explanation of how to use it, keep expectations low though.

## Data
As I said, we used 100 audiofiles each of us saying 'e' continously for 3 seconds. These used to be on the github, but I'd rather not have them on the internet (turns out they're still available in the commit history and someone also forked the repository so can't do nothing about it :)!), and also because it was quite some MB, so I removed them. Therefore, you would need to make new data and that will probably be quite a pain. The file names can be anything as long they are the same with only an upcounting number.
